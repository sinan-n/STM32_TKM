External Led Blinking 
1)Choose the GPIO pin to drive the external LED, refer the user manual to choose a GPIO pin.

2)Select GPIO_Output from the options given by the ide. Here in the example PC6 is the used pin.

3)Assign the cortex if using board with dual core. If using a single core board ignore this part
	*To do that go to system core.
	*Choose GPIO
	*Select the choosen PIN from the given options
	*In the Pin configuration tab , select the Pin context Assignment .
	* Choose the core which is going to drive the Pin.

4)Click on device configuration tool code generator

5)For the boards with dual core , if the user is only using a single core comment the part of code that is defined under DUAL_CORE_BOOT_SYNC_SEQUENCE ( usually start from line 39 to 45, it may vary  ). There will be two main files as there is 2 cores , remember to write the code in the main file which is intended to the core you are using 

6)Under the while section write the code to set the Pin high and Low . It is advisable to insert the code is between the section user code begin and user code end .

7) HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOC, GPIO_PIN_6, SET);  this is the code to set the gpio pin high or low .
	HAL_GPIO_WritePin() is the function 
	GPIOC  - here u define the port ( for eg ; A , B , C . In the experiment we used port C so in the code we say GPIOC)
	GPIO_PIN_6 - here the pin number is defined , we used PC6 as the gpio . 
	SET - SET is used to output High 
	    - similary RESET can be used to ouput LOW

8) Connect a resistor in series with led for protection.
